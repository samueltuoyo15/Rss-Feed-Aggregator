# **RSS Feed Aggregator: Your Curated News Hub**

Dive into a seamless news experience with the **RSS Feed Aggregator**! This project is a lean, mean, and efficient Go application designed to fetch and display RSS/Atom feeds from various sources in one convenient place. Built with performance in mind and featuring a clean web interface powered by HTMX, it's perfect for staying on top of your favorite content without the clutter. ‚ú®

## Installation

Getting this aggregator up and running on your local machine is straightforward. You have a couple of options: directly using Go or leveraging Docker for containerization.

### Prerequisites

*   **Go**: Version 1.24.2 or newer
*   **Git**: For cloning the repository
*   **Docker (Optional)**: If you prefer to run it in a container

### Clone the Repository

First things first, grab the code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samueltuoyo15/Rss-Feed-Aggregator.git
cd Rss-Feed-Aggregator
```

### Option 1: Running with Go

Follow these steps to run the application directly using your Go installation:

1.  üì¶ **Download Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    go mod download
    ```
2.  üõ†Ô∏è **Build the Application**:
    ```bash
    go build -o main ./cmd/main.go
    ```
3.  üöÄ **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    ./main
    ```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Option 2: Running with Docker

For a more isolated and portable setup, Docker is your friend:

1.  üê≥ **Build the Docker Image**:
    ```bash
    docker build -t rss-feed-aggregator .
    ```
2.  üöÄ **Run the Docker Container**:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8080:8080 rss-feed-aggregator
    ```

The application will now be accessible via `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

## Usage

Once the server is running (either via Go or Docker), you can interact with the RSS Feed Aggregator in a couple of ways:

### Web Interface

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`. You'll be greeted by the main page, which automatically fetches and displays the latest articles from the configured RSS feeds. The UI is designed to be responsive, providing a clean reading experience across different devices.

The feed items are loaded using HTMX, providing a snappy, dynamic feel without full page reloads.

### Configuration

The RSS feeds are configured via a YAML file located at `config/feeds.yaml`. You can easily add or remove feeds by editing this file.

Here's an example of the configuration structure:

```yaml
feeds:
  - name: "TechCrunch"
    url: "https://techcrunch.com/feed/"
  - name: "BBC News"
    url: "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml"
  - name: "BBC Sport - Football"
    url: "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/sport/football/rss.xml"
```

After modifying `config/feeds.yaml`, you'll need to restart the application for the changes to take effect.

### API Endpoint

The aggregator also exposes a simple API endpoint for programmatically accessing the aggregated feeds:

*   **GET `/api/feeds`**: Returns a JSON array of all fetched feeds and their respective items. This is what the web interface uses under the hood for initial data and subsequent updates.

Example cURL request:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/feeds
```

## Features

*   üì∞ **Multi-Source Feed Aggregation**: Consolidates articles from multiple RSS/Atom feeds into a single, unified view.
*   üöÄ **Efficient Fetching**: Utilizes Go's concurrency features to fetch feeds in parallel, ensuring quick updates.
*   üñºÔ∏è **Intelligent Thumbnail Extraction**: Beyond standard RSS enclosures, it includes custom logic to extract featured images from linked articles (e.g., TechCrunch).
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **YAML-based Configuration**: Easily add, remove, or modify feed sources by editing a simple `feeds.yaml` file.
*   üåê **Modern Web Interface**: A clean and responsive user interface built with HTML templates, HTMX for dynamic content loading, and Tailwind CSS for styling.
*   üí° **Custom Template Functions**: Includes handy functions for date formatting and content truncation to present information neatly.
*   üì¶ **Docker Support**: Provided `Dockerfile` for easy containerization and deployment.
*   üì° **RESTful API**: Exposes a `/api/feeds` endpoint for consuming the aggregated data programmatically.
